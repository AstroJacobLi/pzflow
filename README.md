## Development

To work on pzflow, after cloning this repo:
1. Create a virtual environment with Python  
E.g., with conda `conda create -n pzflow`
2. Activate the environment.  
E.g., `conda activate pzflow`  
3. Install pzflow in edit mode with the `dev` flag  
I.e., in the root directory, `pip install -e .[dev]`
